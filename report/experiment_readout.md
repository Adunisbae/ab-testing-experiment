## Hypothesis
Users exposed to the treatment will convert at a higher rate than users in the control group.

## Metrics
- Primary: Conversion rate
- Secondary: Time to convert, 7-day retention

## Statistical Method
Bootstrap resampling of difference in proportions with 95% confidence intervals.

## Results
- Observed uplift ≈ +2.4%
- Confidence interval does not include zero

## Interpretation
The positive uplift is consistent across bootstrap samples, indicating a statistically significant improvement due to the treatment.

## Decision
Proceed with incremental rollout and monitor long-term engagement.
